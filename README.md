FUGR is another open soruce web based RSS Reader.

![logo](https://raw.github.com/chr15m/fugr/master/logo.png)

I started writing this when I was angry the first time Google Reader pulled the plug on the social features. Unfortunately development has stalled, but now that Google have shut down Reader entirely I am putting it up on Github in case somebody wants to give it a crack and continue development.

Written in Django & Python with python-feedparser.

See [INSTALL.txt] for instructions on setting it up.

Check out the `./manage.py fugr-*` commands to see how to refresh feeds in the background etc.
