FUGR is another open soruce web based RSS Reader.

Written in Django & Python with python-feedparser.

See [INSTALL.txt] for instructions on setting it up.

Licensed under the [AGPLv3](COPYING-AGPL.txt).

I started writing this when I was angry the first time Google Reader pulled the plug on the social features. Unfortunately development has stalled, but now that Google have shut down Reader entirely I am putting it up on Github in case somebody wants to give it a crack and continue development.
