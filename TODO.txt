 * Show header above spinner when loading feed
 * Make the refresh button actually work
 * get buttons in the bottom of the entry display as well as the top

 * Ability to change feed tags
 * fix the mini spinner (gif transparency sucks)
 * Fix json encoding of struct_time
 * unread counts on feeds
 * Add-feed-by-url interface working (if non-feed URL, shows feeds from that url to select from)

 * Feedback tab
 * Logo in the top right - hovering shows the about bar
   * About link in the about bar (dialog popup)
   * Source code link in the about bar
   * Feature request link in the about bar
 * client-side cache using HTML5 local storage

 * Clone Reader usability
   * 'All items' is default view
   * history management (browser back button should work)
   * reload button on every page
   * drop-down: show all/show new - sort by newest/oldest/magic - search - mark all as read
   * Every tag/feed has a total unread count next to it
   * Clicking a tag instantly shows you its feeds
     * top entry is the feed itself with the aggregated view
     * back button at top left says 'back'
     * entries indented slightly (except top one)
   + tags have a folder icon next to them
   + feeds have an rss icon next to them
   + when you click a feed - loading spinner (so that's ok)
   * feed view features:
     + back button at the top says 'feeds'
     + top: collapse/expand (expand loads basically instantly - but not images - keep HTML but do not insert it yet)
     * top: next item button
     * top: star
     * bottom: star
     * bottom: share/email/share with note
     * bottom: keep unread
     * bottom: edit tags

    print d.feed.link
