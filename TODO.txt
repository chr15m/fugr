 * "more items" button at the bottom of the feed (if more are available)

 * Add-feed-by-url interface working (if non-feed URL, shows feeds from that url to select from)

 * images
   * shrink images on orientation change / resize events too
   * fit images against left hand side
   * make image 100% of width

 * Ability to change feed tags
 * ability to unsubscribe feeds

 * get buttons in the bottom of the entry display as well as the top

 * Show feed header above spinner when loading feed

 * replace icons with a symbols font
   http://www.justbenicestudio.com/studio/websymbols/

 * loop through all entry.content items and show differently depending upon their content-type
   * find and test some youtube ones
   * podcast one like econtalk
   * do side by side comparisons with google reader

 * After filling the screen jump to the top (or the last scroll position for that screen?)

 * javascript snippet for subscribing to a page

 * unread counts on feeds

 * make all external links open in a new window (e.g. feed header).

 * Make the refresh/reload button actually work

 * history management (browser back button should work)
   * reloading page should basically take you to the same look

 * search button searches current heirarchy

 * option in preferences to show/hide read items

 * "mark all as read" button
   * make a special state for this (not actually read)

 * BUG: in aggregated lists 'read'/'like'/'star' are not indicated

---

 *  refactor progress code to use cache instead of database (maybe?)

 * Justify article text
 * font - Maven Pro
 * show items older than 30 days as read

 * About button on home page
 * Feedback tab

 * Logo in the top right - hovering shows the about bar
   * About link in the about bar (dialog popup)
   * Source code link in the about bar
   * Feature request link in the about bar

 * client-side cache using HTML5 local storage
   * always hit the cache first if available
   * show a spinner still
   * wait for the data to come back from the server (if ever)
 * remember last view in cookie/session/user (user? works across devices)

 * Donate button somewhere.
 * Ads?
 * Get rid of ads - subscription?

 * Clone Reader usability
   * 'All items' is default view
   * history management (browser back button should work)
   * reload button on every page
   * drop-down: show all/show new - sort by newest/oldest/magic - search - mark all as read
   * Every tag/feed has a total unread count next to it
   * Clicking a tag instantly shows you its feeds
     + top entry is the feed itself with the aggregated view
     + back button at top left says 'back'
     * entries indented slightly (except top one)
   * feed view features:
     * top: next item button
     * bottom: star
     * bottom: share/email/share with note
     * bottom: keep unread
     * bottom: edit tags
     * bottom: mark interesting
     + top: star
     + back button at the top says 'feeds'
     + top: collapse/expand
       (expand loads basically instantly - but not images - keep HTML but do not insert it yet)
   + tags have a folder icon next to them
   + feeds have an rss icon next to them
   + when you click a feed - loading spinner (so that's ok)

 * Friend searching by email/username/name
 * Commenting

 * "Downloadable" version made with xulrunner
   * Android app?

 * force ff and webkit to execute all scripts on 'back': $(window).unload( function () {} );

Done

 + show non-tagged feeds at the top level
 + Actually fetch some feeds
    import feedparser
    d = feedparser.parse("http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/twelvetone")

    print d.feed.title
    print d.feed.link
    print d['items'][1].title
